# object-detection-with-fpga
Object Detection Using Sound Localization - This project is for the Nexys4 FPGA. 

It takes sound input from a pair of microphones and measures the phase difference to locate the source. 

Output controls a servo which continually points to the source.

Please see the full writeup ObjectDetectionWithSoundLocalization.pdf for the full project overview.

Enjoy!
